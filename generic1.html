                <h2>The haiya’s Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    In the bustling streets of  Malaysia Chinatown, Mr. Wong was known for his famous noodle shop. Every
                    day, people from all over the city would line up to taste his delicious noodles. Mr. Wong
                    was a perfectionist, always ensuring that each bowl was cooked to perfection.
                    <br /><br />
                    One busy afternoon, a young boy named Timmy walked into the shop. He had heard legends about
                    Mr. Wong’s noodles and was eager to try them. As he approached the counter, he saw Mr. Wong
                    in deep concentration, stirring a large pot of broth.
                    <br /><br />

                    <img class="small-thumb" src="images/noodle.jpg" alt="" />
                    “Excuse me, Mr. Wong,” Timmy said politely. “Can I have a bowl of your famous noodles?”
                    <br /><br />
                    Mr. Wong looked up, his face breaking into a warm smile. “Of course, young man! One bowl of
                    noodles coming right up!”
                    <br /><br />
                    As Mr. Wong prepared the noodles, Timmy watched in awe. The way Mr. Wong moved, with
                    precision and grace, was like watching an artist at work. Finally, the bowl was ready, and
                    Mr. Wong handed it to Timmy.
                    <br /><br />
                    Timmy took a bite and his eyes widened in delight. “This is amazing!” he exclaimed. “Thank
                    you so much, Mr. Wong!”
                    <br /><br />
                    Mr. Wong chuckled. “I’m glad you like it. Enjoy your meal!”
                    <br /><br />
                    Just then, a loud crash came from the kitchen. Mr. Wong’s assistant, Mei, had accidentally
                    knocked over a stack of bowls. “haiya!” Mr. Wong exclaimed, rushing to help her.
                    <br /><br />
                    Timmy couldn’t help but giggle. “What does ‘haiya’ mean, Mr. Wong?”
                    <br /><br />
                    Mr. Wong smiled as he helped Mei pick up the bowls. “It’s an expression we use when
                    something unexpected happens. It can mean surprise, frustration, or even amusement. In this
                    case, it’s a little bit of all three!”
                    <br /><br />
                    Timmy nodded, understanding. “haiya,” he repeated, trying it out for himself.
                    <br /><br />
                    Mr. Wong laughed. “That’s right! Now, finish your noodles before they get cold.”
                    <br /><br />
                    As Timmy enjoyed the rest of his meal, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of warmth and
                    belonging. In that moment, he knew he would always remember the day he learned the meaning
                    of “haiya” in Mr. Wong’s noodle shop.
