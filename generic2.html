                <!-- <h2>The haiya’s Journey</h2> -->
                <p>
                    Years passed, and Timmy grew up, always cherishing the memory of Mr. Wong’s noodle shop and
                    the expression “haiya.” Inspired by the warmth and community he felt there, Timmy decided to
                    start his own clothing brand. He named it “haiya.my,” aiming to capture the spirit of
                    surprise, joy, and resilience that the word embodied.
                    <br /><br />
                    Timmy’s designs were unique, blending traditional  Malaysia Chinatown elements with modern fashion.
                    Each piece of clothing had a small tag with the word “haiya” and a short message of
                    encouragement or love. His brand quickly gained popularity, not just for its stylish designs
                    but also for the positive messages it spread.
                    <br /><br />
                    One day, Timmy decided to visit Mr. Wong’s noodle shop to share his success. As he walked
                    in, he saw Mr. Wong still working diligently, serving customers with the same passion as
                    always.
                    <br /><br />
                    
                    <img class="small-thumb" src="images/image.webp" alt=""   />
                    “Mr. Wong!” Timmy called out, waving.
                    <br /><br />
                    Mr. Wong looked up and smiled warmly. “Timmy! It’s been so long. How have you been?”
                    <br /><br />
                    Timmy beamed. “I’ve been great, Mr. Wong. I started my own clothing brand called ‘haiya
                     ,’ inspired by you and your shop.”
                    <br /><br />
                    Mr. Wong’s eyes twinkled with pride. “That’s wonderful, Timmy! I’m so happy for you.”
                    <br /><br />
                    Timmy handed Mr. Wong a beautifully designed jacket with the “haiya” tag. “This is for you,
                    Mr. Wong. Thank you for everything.”
                    <br /><br />
                    Mr. Wong accepted the gift with gratitude. “Thank you, Timmy. This means a lot to me.”
                    <br /><br />
                    But Timmy wasn’t done yet. He had another idea to spread love and positivity. He asked Mr.
                    Wong if he could help in the kitchen for a day. Mr. Wong agreed, curious to see what Timmy
                    had in mind.
                    <br /><br />
                    Timmy prepared special fortune cookies with messages of love and encouragement inside. As
                    customers enjoyed their meals, they were delighted to find these little surprises, each one
                    bringing a smile to their faces.
                    <br /><br />
                    One customer read their message aloud: “haiya! Life is full of surprises. Embrace them with
                    a smile.” The entire shop erupted in laughter and applause.
                    <br /><br />
                    Mr. Wong watched with tears of joy in his eyes. “Timmy, you’ve truly captured the essence of
                    ‘haiya.’ You’ve turned it into something beautiful that brings people together.”
                    <br /><br />
                    Timmy smiled, feeling a deep sense of fulfillment. “Thank you, Mr. Wong. I couldn’t have
                    done it without you.”
                    <br /><br />
                    From that day on, “haiya.my” and Mr. Wong’s noodle shop became symbols of love,
                    positivity, and community in  Malaysia Chinatown. And every time someone exclaimed “haiya,” it was a
                    reminder of the unexpected joys and connections that life brings.
